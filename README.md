# Auth0 Vue.js Samples

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/auth0-samples/auth0-vue-samples.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/auth0-samples/auth0-vue-samples)

This is the sample code for the [Auth0 Vue.js Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/vuejs-beta) using the beta version of [@auth0/auth0-vue](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-vue).

There are two sample applications:

- [01 - Login](./01-Login) — demonstrates logging in and viewing profile information
- [02 - Calling an API](./02-Calling-an-API) — demonstrates how to call a third-party API using access tokens

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/connections), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/security/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
